#  EPICODUS STUDENT PROJECT | BDD Practice: Build a Roman Numeral Converter

## Roman Numeral Converter, August 22, 2016

###  By Dean Scelza & Angie Smith

### Description

#### This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather number and translate them into to Roman Numerals (using back-end logic). This is an lesson in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to learn to code using just the least amount of clean code to establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs.

1. return what the user inputs
    * Input example: 3
    * Output example: 3
  2. check if input is a positive integer
    * Input example: a
    * Output example: please enter a positive integer
  3. parse the input into a number
    * Input example: "3"
    * Output example: 3
  4. notify user they cannot go past 3999
    * Input example: 3999
    * Output example: please enter a smaller number
  5. display the symbols that add up to the inputted number
    * Input example: 2
    * Output example: II
  6. determine if there are three like consecutive, if so, replace those symbols with the next level of symbol
    * Input example: 4
    * Output example: IV
  7. put symbols in correct order
    * Input example: 4
    * Output example: IV
  8. process each number individually and recognize the placement of it
    * Input example: 1358
    * Output example: MCCLVIII
